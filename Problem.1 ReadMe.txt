Problem.1 - During application migration from one server to another server folders are copied. However the folder copy process failed.
There are two options,

1. Restart the folder copy process from beginning
2. Write a small utility that will create folders that were missed during folder migration.

Solution - 

Pre Requisite - Download python interpreter or download Anaconda so that you can code python script in Spyder.

Steps to Use:
- Create 2 Directories with different folder depth in CLI.
- Now open the attached problem1.py file in Spyder or any python interpreter.
- Inside problem1.py specify the path of the server/directory which you want to replicate at "source_server_path".
- Also specify the destination server/directory where you want the folders to be replicated at "destination_server_path".
- Now Run the script, and it will create any missing folders in the destination directory.



Pseudo Code

Initialize Data Structures:
 -source_folders: to store the paths of all folders in the source directory.
 -destination_folders: to store the paths of all folders in the destination directory.
 -missing_folders: to store the paths of folders that are in the source but not in the destination.

Function: Get All Folders
Input: root_dir (the directory from which to collect all folder paths)
Process:
-Initialize an empty set called folder_set.
-Traverse the directory structure starting from root_dir:
-Return the folder_set.
Output: A set containing all relative folder paths under root_dir.

Function: Create Missing Folders
Input: source_root (the root directory of the source), dest_root (the root directory of the destination)
Process:
- Call Get All Folders function with source_root as input and store the result in source_folders.
- Call Get All Folders function with dest_root as input and store the result in destination_folders.
- Compute missing_folders as the difference between source_folders and destination_folders.
- If missing_folders is empty:
    -Print a message indicating that no folders are missing.
- Otherwise:
    -For each folder in missing_folders:
    -Construct the full path of the folder in the destination directory by combining dest_root and the relative folder path.
    -Create the folder.
-Print a message that the folder is created.
-Print the total number of folders created.

Main Function
Call Create Missing Folders function with the source and destination paths as inputs.


Example:

Input:
Source directory: /path/to/source
Destination directory: /path/to/destination

Get All Folders:
Traverse /path/to/source to find all folders and subfolders.
Traverse /path/to/destination to find all folders and subfolders.

Compare Folders:
Determine which folders in the source directory are missing in the destination directory.
Create Missing Folders:
For each missing folder, create it in the destination directory.

Output:
Print which folders were created or indicate if no folders were missing.

Test cases:
1. Input: Source - source/folder1/folder2
	  Destination - destination/folder1/folder2
   Output: All folders are present. No missing folders.
2. Input: Source - source/folder1/folder2/subfolder
          Destination - destination/folder1
   Output: 
	  destination/folder1/folder2/subfolder
